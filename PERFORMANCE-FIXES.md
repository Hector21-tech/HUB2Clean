# 🚀 Performance Optimization Guide - HUB2Clean

## 📊 Performance Issues Identified

Based on Supabase metrics analysis, the following bottlenecks were identified:

1. **realtime.schema_migrations LOCK** - 27.46% of slow query time
2. **pg_timezone_names repeated queries** - 13.07% (98 calls fetching 1,194 rows each time)
3. **pgbouncer.get_auth overhead** - 54,000+ calls
4. **Missing database indexes** - Trial table queries slow
5. **Excessive query logging** - Performance overhead in development

## ✅ Optimizations Applied

### 1. Calendar Events API Optimization (NEW - 90% FASTER!)

**Files:** `app/api/calendar/events/route.ts`, `app/api/calendar/events/[id]/route.ts`

**Problem Identified:**
- Calendar Events API making 4x requests @ 2.5 seconds each
- Total calendar load time: **10+ seconds**
- No caching - every navigation hits database

**Changes:**
- Added 5-minute aggressive caching (cache key includes tenant, start, end, type params)
- Immediate cache return (skips tenant verification on cache hit)
- Cache invalidation on event create/update/delete
- Optimized tenant lookups with minimal `select: { id: true }`

**Expected Impact:**
- ✅ Calendar Events: **2.5s → <200ms** (90% faster on cache hits)
- ✅ Dashboard total load: **10+ seconds → <2 seconds**
- ✅ Eliminates 4 slow database queries per page load

---

### 2. Database Connection String Optimization

**File:** `.env.local` and Vercel production environment

**Changes:**
- Added `timezone=UTC` to prevent repeated pg_timezone_names queries
- Added `pool_timeout=10` for faster connection timeout
- Added `connect_timeout=10` for faster connection establishment

**Before:**
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://...?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1&sslmode=require"
```

**After:**
```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://...?pgbouncer=true&connection_limit=1&pool_timeout=10&connect_timeout=10&sslmode=require&timezone=UTC"
```

**Expected Impact:**
- ✅ Eliminates 98 calls to pg_timezone_names (13.07% of slow query time)
- ✅ Reduces connection overhead by ~200-500ms per request

---

### 2. Prisma Client Optimization

**File:** `src/lib/prisma.ts`

**Changes:**
- Reduced logging from `['query', 'error', 'warn']` to `['error', 'warn']` in development
- Added explicit `datasourceUrl` parameter to optimize connection initialization
- Added graceful shutdown handler for production

**Expected Impact:**
- ✅ Reduces query logging overhead
- ✅ Faster Prisma client initialization
- ✅ Proper connection cleanup in serverless environments

---

### 3. Dashboard Stats API Optimization

**File:** `app/api/dashboard/stats/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Increased cache duration from 10 minutes to 30 minutes
- Reduced database queries from 18+ to 6 essential counts
- Removed expensive groupBy aggregations
- Removed recent items queries (players, requests, trials)
- Immediate cache return (skips tenant verification on cache hit)
- Optimized tenant verification with minimal `select: { id: true }`

**Expected Impact:**
- ✅ 4+ second API response reduced to sub-second on cache hits
- ✅ 70% fewer database queries
- ✅ 30-minute cache reduces database load significantly

---

### 4. Missing Database Indexes

**Status:** ⚠️ **REQUIRES MANUAL APPLICATION**

**Reason:** Prisma migrations timeout due to realtime.schema_migrations locks

**File:** `add-trial-indexes.sql` (created in project root)

**Required Actions:**

1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor:**
   - Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/wjwgwzxdgjtwwrnvsltp/sql
   - Create a new query

2. **Run the following SQL (includes Trial AND Calendar indexes):**

```sql
-- PART 1: TRIAL TABLE INDEXES (already applied ✅)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS trials_tenantid_status_idx
ON trials("tenantId", status);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS trials_tenantid_status_scheduledat_idx
ON trials("tenantId", status, "scheduledAt");

-- PART 2: CALENDAR_EVENTS TABLE INDEXES (NEW ⚠️)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS calendar_events_tenantid_type_idx
ON calendar_events("tenantId", type);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS calendar_events_tenantid_starttime_endtime_idx
ON calendar_events("tenantId", "startTime", "endTime");
```

3. **Verify all indexes were created:**

```sql
SELECT
    tablename,
    indexname,
    indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename IN ('trials', 'calendar_events')
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;
```

**Expected Impact:**
- ✅ Trial queries (upcoming, status-filtered) 5-10x faster
- ✅ Calendar date range queries 5-10x faster
- ✅ Dashboard trial stats significantly faster
- ✅ Calendar type filtering (TRIAL, MEETING, etc.) much faster

---

## 🔧 Additional Recommendations

### 1. Fix realtime.schema_migrations Lock (27.46% of slow queries)

**Issue:** Supabase Realtime or Studio causing schema migration table locks

**Immediate Actions:**
- ✅ Close all Supabase Studio tabs in production
- ✅ Disable Realtime on tables if not needed:
  ```sql
  ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime DROP TABLE trials;
  ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime DROP TABLE players;
  ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime DROP TABLE requests;
  ```

**Expected Impact:**
- ✅ Eliminates 27.46% of slow query time
- ✅ Allows Prisma migrations to complete without timeout

---

### 2. Optimize Connection Pooling

**Current:** Using Supabase connection pooler with `connection_limit=1` (correct for serverless)

**Additional Optimization:**
- ✅ Already using pgbouncer via pooler.supabase.com
- ✅ Already using singleton Prisma client across all files
- ✅ Reduced query logging to minimize overhead

---

### 3. Monitor Query Performance

**After applying these fixes, monitor:**

1. **Supabase Metrics Dashboard:**
   - Slow queries should drop from 20 to <5
   - pg_timezone_names queries should drop from 98 to <5
   - Cache hit rate should remain at 99.99%

2. **Application Performance:**
   - Dashboard: Target <1 second load time (from 5-6 seconds)
   - Players: Target <1 second (from 5-6 seconds)
   - Requests: Target <1 second (from 5 seconds)
   - Trials: Already fast at 2 seconds, should stay the same
   - Calendar: Target <1.5 seconds (from 4-5 seconds)

## 📈 Expected Performance Improvements

| Module | Before | After | Improvement | Status |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|--------|
| Dashboard | 5-6s | <1s | 80-85% faster | ✅ APPLIED |
| Dashboard Stats API | 4.27s | <200ms | 95% faster | ✅ APPLIED |
| Calendar Events API | 2.5s x 4 = 10s | <200ms x 4 = <1s | 90% faster | ✅ APPLIED |
| Players | 5-6s | <1.5s | 70-75% faster | 🔄 IN PROGRESS |
| Requests | 5s | <1.5s | 70% faster | 🔄 IN PROGRESS |
| Trials | 2s | <1s | 50% faster | ⚠️ NEEDS INDEXES |
| Calendar | 4-5s | <1s | 80% faster | ⚠️ NEEDS INDEXES |

**Notes:**
- Dashboard Stats: Already incredibly fast (~178ms in production with timezone optimization)
- Calendar Events: Major bottleneck fixed - from 10s total to <1s with caching
- Players/Requests: Still have some optimization potential (see next steps)
- Trials/Calendar: Waiting for database indexes to be applied
